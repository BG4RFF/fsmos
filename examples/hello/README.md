# Helloworld of FSMOS for Arduino

This project is a tiny helloworld demo using [FSMOS](https://github.com/qiwenmin/fsmos).

Before compiling this project, FSMOS should be installed as a library
of Arduino.

If your board is Digispark, this demo can be compiled on Arduino
without any modifications. If you are using the different board, you
may need modify the PIN numbers in `led.h` and `button.h`.
